This is my personal website and portfolio

Current address: https://christomaskovic.netlify.app/

The top of the page outputs some text that describes a little bit about me and my education. It also incorporates some friendly images.


The Languages section displays the current programming languages that I am familiar with. This will be updated as I further my education.

Moving on the the Projects section, I don't have any projects that I feel are worthy of being displayed yet, so there is an example of what it would look like. This will also be updated as I further my education.

The last section is the bottom of the page. If you click on my logo it will bring you to the top of my page, and there is an animation that informs you of that.

Throughout my page there are icons for either my email or github. Clicking on these icons will bring you to the respective location.
If you click on something that will bring you to an external link at anytime, it will open it in a new tab for you.
