Chris Tomaskovic

The top of the page is my name and a menu that has links to the languages and projects section and a way to contact me.
Below that it outputs a picture of me and some text that describes a little bit about me and my education with a link to an About me page. It also incorporates some friendly images.


The Languages section displays the current programming languages that I have experience with. 

Moving on the the Projects section, this is where I will display some of my favorite personal projects.

The last section is the bottom of the page. If you click on my logo it will bring you to the top of my page, and there is an animation that informs you of that.

Throughout my page there are icons for either my email or github. Clicking on these icons will bring you to the respective location.
If you click on something that will bring you to an external link at anytime, it will open it in a new tab for you.

Gallery

Photography is one of my passions and hobbies and I wanted a way to showcase some of my pictures. I also added a parallax feature which I feel adds a nice touch as you scroll through the images. This makes the images come to life 
and appear to be scrolling as you move left to right.
