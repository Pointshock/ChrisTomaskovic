                        Alexander AI is an innovative project that showcases my expertise in artificial intelligence and financial technology. It is an advanced stock forecasting tool that harnesses the power of cutting-edge LSTM models and real-time sentiment analysis from social media to predict stock prices with unparalleled accuracy.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What sets Alexander AI apart is its unique combination of AI-driven forecasting and social media integration. This innovative approach allows users to make informed investment decisions by considering both historical data and the current market sentiment reflected in social media forums. The result is a tool that empowers investors and traders with timely insights, giving them a competitive advantage in the dynamic world of stock trading.

                        <br>
                        Notably, Alexander AI also features a user-friendly mobile application with a custom API for independent prediction. This means that users can access forecasted open prices on the go without relying on a server, ensuring convenience and real-time access to critical market information.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Furthermore, Alexander AI places a strong emphasis on data security. It incorporates a custom script designed to safeguard against common vulnerabilities, guaranteeing the protection of user data and financial information.

                        I was not alone on my journey to create Alexander AI. While being the lead programmer, I also lead a team of talented individuals who helped me bring this project to life. I would like to thank my team members, Hunter Devries-Ramirez and Anthony Shank, for their contributions to this project.

                        For an in-depth overview of Alexander AI and its creation, I created the video below as a presentation for my student innovation project at UAT.
