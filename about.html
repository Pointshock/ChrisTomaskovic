                        I grew up surrounded by technology and that eventually turned into my passion. I came to college
                        wanting to do programming and chose Advancing Computer Science as my major. After learning more
                        about the classes the University of Advancing Technology offered and doing research, a dual
                        major in Artificial Intelligence felt like the right move for me. I am proud of what I have
                        learned and am excited to develop my skillset further.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Some of my hobbies besides programming are skiing, hiking, photography, listening to music, 
                        and playing video games. I also love to learn new things so you'll see me reading books or watching
                        educational videos.

                        I am currently a Student Ambassador for the University of Advancing Technology. While I enjoy the 
                        Student Ambassador role, I am also looking for any intership opporunities in the tech field.
